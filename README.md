# The Generic Spacecraft Ontology  (The Foundational / Upper-level / Top-level Spacecraft Ontology & Taxonomy)

This is an _abstraction model_ (ontology, conceptual model) at the highest relative degree of abstraction capable of categorizing all types of spacecraft.
It offers a high-level taxonomy of generic spacecraft categories, and associated defined terminology. The Top-level/Upper/Generic/Foundational Spacecraft Ontology is a computable knowledge representation serving as a top-level taxonomy and ontology for lower-level or more specialized spacecraft models and categories. 

## Scope
All types of spacecraft. Example types of spacecraft: Communications Spacecraft, Unmanned Spaceraft, Space Station, Interplanetary spacecraft, Space telescope, etc.

## Status
